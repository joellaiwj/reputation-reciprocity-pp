These codes were used to produce the figures found in an upcoming publication:
1. Generate_Initialization.py: Produces the initial conditions for the network and assigns attributes to the network
2. Reciprocity.py: Applies the reciprocity social rule
3. Reputation.py: Applies the reputation social rule based on beta-distribution-like distribution.
4. Iteration.py: Main script that calls the previous three and output the data required to plot figures.
